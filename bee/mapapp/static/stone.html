    <hr>
    <p>
        The granitic rocks in the area were formed towards the end of the Archean Era of the geological time scale, due to magmatic action
        leading to the melting of the older gneissic rocks and intrusion. The thickness of this younger granitic complex varies from 5 to 25 km.
        Virpattu village is located in Gingee taluka of Viluppuram district in Tamil Nadu, India. Viluppuram and Gingee are the district & sub-district
        headquarters of Virpattu village respectively. Gingee is the nearest town to Virpattu for all major economic activities, which is approximately
        5km away.
